# Welcome!

I am a software engineer with [Cisco Webex](https://www.webex.com/),
focusing on React, Redux, and Node.js for web apps.

Technical interests for 2023 include Typescript conversions, [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components), and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
