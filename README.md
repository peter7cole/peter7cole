# Welcome! ðŸ¦•

I am a software engineer at Cisco developing 
[Webex](https://web.webex.com/),
focusing on React and Typescript for dynamic web apps.

Technical interests for 2025 include experimenting with 
[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), contributing to external 
projects, and dabbling with [Lit](https://lit.dev/) Web Components.
